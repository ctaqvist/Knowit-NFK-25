# TICKET 24: Define platform

In this ticket we will discuss what platform should we build on

## Tablet

Since a high level requirement was to use tablet, we must use a tablet.

## iOS vs Android or web

Since tablet has two main operative systems and web, we essentially have 3 options. Since good user experience is important it might seem more intutive to use native development than web development.

## Available devices

Right now we only have access to an Android tablet.

## Team preferences

The UI team has slight preference for iOS but are open. The development team slitghly prefer Android as native development can be done on any computer (as opposed to iOS which must be done on a mac).

## Final proposal

Since we must use a tablet and we only have an Android tablet to use we propose to use Android tablet. We are open for which framework to use.
